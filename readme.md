# PX to SVG (WIP)

> A simple WordPress plugin that will allow users to upload raster images and convert them to usable SVGs with a shortcode.


### Shortcode


### To-Do

- Check if filename already exists when converting and uploading
- Add a "Library" page (shows all the SVGs)
- Batch file upload
- Add a settings page (save dir, default threshold, compress/not compress SVG, etc...)
- Add support for PNG somehow? [Example 1](http://brianflove.com/2014/12/10/png-support-for-php-on-os-x-yosemite/), [Example 2](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26493762/yosemite-php-gd-mcrypt-installation)
- Shortcode
  - Get all the attributes working (color, width, height)
  - How-to in the readme
  - Add a button above the editor to insert a shortcode (able to choose from created SVGs)
- Add the uploaded image as fallback, or include a field
- Create an SVG sprite? [Example](http://24ways.org/2014/an-overview-of-svg-sprite-creation-techniques/)
- Add the ability to edit the SVG's?
